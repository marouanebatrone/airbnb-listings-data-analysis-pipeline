# Mini data platform on AWS

I built this project to serve as a reference for enterprises or individuals who want to design and deploy a modern data platform on AWS Cloud. It can be helpful whether you are migrating from a legacy system or starting from scratch to build a scalable data infrastructure.

For simplicity, I used the open dataset from **Airbnb** (available at [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data)).

## Architecture

The following diagram summarizes the overall data platform architecture:
